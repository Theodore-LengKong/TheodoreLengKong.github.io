                    I am a bio-inspired fluid dynamicist focusing on agile flight and efficient swimming. Through computational fluid dynamics simulations, machine learning, and experimental robotics, I investigate how biological flyers and swimmers achieve remarkable performance and develop design principles for autonomous vehicles. My research provides guidance for the aerodynamic optimization of micro aerial vehicles and the hydrodynamic design of underwater robots.

                  <p>
                    <strong>My approach to bio-inspired systems:</strong> I believe that understanding the fundamental physics governing biological flight and swimming enables us to extract actionable design principles for engineered systems. By combining high-fidelity CFD simulations on the UVA Rivanna Supercomputer with machine learning algorithms and experimental validation, I identify which biological features are essential for performance and which can be simplified for practical robotic implementation. My work spans from analyzing damselfly aerodynamics to developing artificial lateral line systems for underwater robots, with applications ranging from micro air vehicles to autonomous underwater vehicles for drag reduction and energy harvesting.

                    <strong>Technical approach:</strong> The dragonfly's independent four-wing control enables unprecedented maneuverability through asymmetric wing kinematics during turning and the ability to optimize each wing's parameters for specific flight modes. By leveraging insights from my damselfly backward flight and gliding research, we design wing structures that balance aerodynamic efficiency with structural robustness while meeting autonomous flight control requirements.

                    Developing machine learning models to classify fish positions within schools using pressure sensor data and predict optimal schooling configurations for thrust/drag optimization. By analyzing high-fidelity CFD simulations of schooling fish, we train neural networks to identify a fish's location and orientation relative to neighbors based solely on the pressure field it experiences, without requiring vision or inertial sensing.

                    <strong>Key innovation:</strong> Our models achieve high accuracy in position classification using minimal sensor configurations, demonstrating that distributed pressure sensing alone provides sufficient information for schooling coordination. This research has direct applications for coordinating robotic fish swarms and understanding collective behavior in biological schools, with implications for energy-efficient formation control in autonomous underwater vehicles.

                    Investigating optimal gliding configurations for damselflies to maximize aerodynamic efficiency using computational fluid dynamics simulations and aerodynamic force analysis. Through parametric studies varying wing sweep angle and angle of attack, we identify configurations that optimize lift-to-drag ratio during unpowered gliding flight.

                    <strong>Applications:</strong> This research provides design guidance for energy-efficient micro aerial vehicles capable of extended surveillance missions through intermittent gliding. By understanding how damselflies minimize drag during glides between flapping cycles, we extract scaling laws applicable to bio-inspired MAV design for maximizing flight endurance.

Using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations on the UVA Rivanna Supercomputer, we analyzed how damselflies achieve this rare capability through precisely coordinated forewing and hindwing kinematics generating rearward thrust while maintaining sufficient lift.

                    Designed 5kg payload capacity drone with 1.5-hour flight time. Implemented autonomous flight control and real-time video monitoring. The vertical take-off and landing capability enables operation in constrained environments while the fixed-wing cruise mode provides efficient long-range delivery. Integrated custom flight controller with GPS waypoint navigation and return-to-home safety features.

                    Performed aerodynamic force calculations for P-51 Mustang flight control systems, contributing to aircraft modifications for air racing competition. Designed CAD models and carbon fiber components using SolidWorks, balancing aerodynamic performance with structural requirements and weight constraints. Analyzed mechanical systems and developed 3D-printable aircraft components for rapid prototyping. This experience bridged theoretical aerodynamics with practical manufacturing considerations, teaching me how design decisions must account for material properties, fabrication methods, and real-world operational constraints.

Designed hands-on activities teaching elementary students basic electronics, middle schoolers programming and video game design, and high schoolers robotic design principles. Mentored students in engineering concepts and adapting explanations to different age groups and learning styles. Watching students' excitement when their robots successfully followed a line or their code finally worked reinforced my commitment to making STEM education accessible and engaging.
